# [PhotoFF] A CUDA-accelerated image processing library I developed as a self-taught Python developer

Hi everyone,

I'm a self-taught Python developer and I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on: [PhotoFF](https://github.com/offerrall/photoff), a GPU-accelerated image processing library.

## What My Project Does

PhotoFF is a high-performance image processing library that uses CUDA to achieve exceptional processing speeds. It provides a complete toolkit for image manipulation including:

- Loading and saving images in common formats
- Applying filters (blur, grayscale, corner radius, etc.)
- Resizing and transforming images
- Blending multiple images
- Filling with colors and gradients
- Advanced memory management for optimal GPU performance

The library handles all GPU memory operations behind the scenes, making it easy to create complex image processing pipelines without worrying about memory allocation and deallocation.

## Target Audience

PhotoFF is designed for:

- **Python developers** who need high-performance image processing
- **Data scientists and researchers** working with large batches of images
- **Application developers** building image editing or processing tools
- **CUDA enthusiasts** interested in efficient GPU programming techniques

While it started as a personal learning project, PhotoFF is robust enough for production use in applications that require fast image processing. It's particularly useful for scenarios where processing time is critical or where large numbers of images need to be processed.

## Comparison with Existing Alternatives

Compared to existing Python image processing libraries:

- **vs. Pillow/PIL**: PhotoFF is significantly faster for batch operations thanks to GPU acceleration. While Pillow is CPU-bound, PhotoFF can process multiple images simultaneously on the GPU.

- **vs. OpenCV**: While OpenCV also offers GPU acceleration via CUDA, PhotoFF provides a cleaner Python-centric API and focuses specifically on efficient memory management with its unique buffer reuse approach.

- **vs. TensorFlow/PyTorch image functions**: These libraries are optimized for neural network operations. PhotoFF is more lightweight and focused specifically on image processing rather than machine learning.

The key innovation in PhotoFF is its approach to GPU memory management:
- Most libraries create new memory allocations for each operation
- PhotoFF allows pre-allocating buffers once and dynamically changing their logical dimensions as needed
- This virtually eliminates memory fragmentation and allocation overhead during processing

## Basic example:

```python
from photoff.operations.filters import apply_gaussian_blur, apply_corner_radius
from photoff.io import save_image, load_image
from photoff import CudaImage

# Load the image in GPU memory
src_image: CudaImage = load_image("./image.jpg")

# Apply filters
apply_gaussian_blur(src_image, radius=5.0)
apply_corner_radius(src_image, size=200)

# Save the result
save_image(src_image, "./result.png")

# Free the image from GPU memory
src_image.free()
```

## My motivation

As a self-taught developer, I built this library to solve performance issues I encountered when working with large volumes of images. The memory management technique I implemented turned out to be very efficient:

```python
# Allocate a large buffer once
buffer = CudaImage(5000, 5000)

# Process multiple images by adjusting logical dimensions
buffer.width, buffer.height = 800, 600
process_image_1(buffer)

buffer.width, buffer.height = 1200, 900
process_image_2(buffer)

# No additional memory allocations or deallocations needed!
```

## Looking for feedback

I would love to receive your comments, suggestions, or constructive criticism on:
- API design
- Performance and optimizations
